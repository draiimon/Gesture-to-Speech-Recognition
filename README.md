Sign Language Recognition with Python

This Python application allows you to recognize sign language gestures using your webcam. It leverages the power of computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and Mediapipe to capture camera frames, detect hand landmarks, and interpret gestures.

Requirements:

tkinter: For the GUI components.
cv2 (OpenCV): For capturing camera frames and image processing.
PIL (Pillow): For image manipulation.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
numpy: For numerical operations.
mediapipe: For hand landmark detection.
ttkthemes: For themed styles in tkinter.
You can install these dependencies using pip. Here's the command to install them:

pip install tk
pip install opencv-python-headless # Install headless version of OpenCV to avoid tkinter conflicts
pip install pillow
pip install pyttsx3
pip install numpy
pip install mediapipe
pip install ttkthemes

Usage:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies using the provided commands.
Run the main.py file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
